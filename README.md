# Speech-Module-RPA
Speech Module of Robotic Personal Assistant

The Robotic Personal Assistant(RPA) performs various actions. The RPA project involves 3 main modules.
The main modules are,
      1. Speech
      2. CVI
      3. Navigation.
I worked on the Speech Module of the RPA. 

Text Summarization -> It condenses a text file while preserving the key informational elements and the context meaning.
Natural Language TookKit(NLTK) was used for this purpose.

YouTube Video Player -> Once a command of "Alfred Play, ....." is given it will recognize the speech and then convert this speech to text. 'pyttsx3' was used for the purpose of text-to-speech conversion. Once the engine recognises the speech and converts to text, it will go to YouTube and play the most viewed video as it will be the most relevant.
